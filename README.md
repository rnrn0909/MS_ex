## Exercise: Make a Simulation Log Table

Make a simulation log table for the Inventory Management Model using the replenishment policy parameters

    reorder level = 30
    reorder-up-to level = 60

and the initial state setting

    stock quantity = 50

First make two tables for mapping random digit sequences to the possible values of the two random variables (like the corresponding tables in the presentation slides DES Example 1).

Then create a simulation log table for 25 simulation steps, using the random digits table below.

Use the assumption that in the case of a pair of simultaneous Delivery and DailyDemand events, the Delivery event is processed first, before the DailyDemand event.
